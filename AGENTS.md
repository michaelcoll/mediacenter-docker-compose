# CRITICAL RULES - MUST FOLLOW

## RESPONSES

-   Keep responses concise and to the point - unless the user asks otherwise

## PLANNING MODE

-   Always ask clarifying questions
-   Never assume design, tech stack or features
-   Use deep-dive sub-agents to assist with research
-   Use deep-dive sub-agents to review the different aspects of your plan before presenting to the user
-   Create a plan with clear steps and deliverables, and save it in the .agents/plans directory for future reference and
    implementation

## CHANGE / EDIT MODE

-   Never implement features yourself when possible - use sub-agents!
-   Identify changes from the plan that can be implemented in parallel, and use sub-agents to implement the features
    efficiently
-   When using sub-agents to implement features, act as a coordinator only
-   After completing features (large or small), always run commands like lint, type check and next build to check code
    quality

## TESTING

-   Use any testing tools, libraries available to the project for testing your changes
-   Never assume your changes simply work, always test!

## Codebase Exploration Tools (Prefer these over shell commands)

-   bash: Execute shell commands (Git, npm, etc.) when specialized tools are insufficient.
-   edit: Precisely modify the content of an existing file (string replacement).
-   glob: Search for files using patterns.
-   grep: Search file contents for a specific pattern (regex).
-   read: Read the content of a file at a given offset.
-   question: Ask the user questions to clarify instructions or make decisions.
-   skill: Load a specialized skill if the task matches a predefined profile.
-   task: Launch an autonomous agent for complex, multi-step tasks.
-   todowrite: Maintain a structured to-do list for tracking complex projects.
-   webfetch: Retrieve content from an external URL.
-   write: Write or create a new file on the filesystem.

## RTK — Token-Optimized CLI

**rtk** prefixes shell commands to compress output (e.g., `rtk git status`).

### Meta Commands

-   `rtk gain`: Token savings dashboard.
-   `rtk discover`: Find missed `rtk` opportunities.
